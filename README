APPTBOT
Author: Lyle Kozloff

Description:
The US Embassy in Bangkok is often booked several weeks in advance. New parents 
wanting to get home often get 'stuck' in Bangkok waiting for an appointments.
Some resort to obsessively checking the website in order to move their appointment
up, others just accept their lot in life.

APPTBOT is a simple script to check the US Embassy website for appointments and
email you when one comes available.

Requirements:
- PHP5
- CURL
- sendmail

Installation:
- modify the to, from, subject and header variables
- modify the month you want to check
- set up a cron job to run apptbot.php at whatever interval you desire.
- get home earlier than you would have otherwise!

Future:
It should be trivial to update for any country in the world. All US Embassies use the
same appointment system. It would also not be difficult to modify for different 
types of appointments.

If one was so inclined, it would not be impossible to make and cancel appointments 
with a similar (rough) approach as outlined here.
